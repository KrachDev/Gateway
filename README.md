Gateway is a game launcher application that aims to be an all-in-one solution for gamers. It was born out of a previous app that I was working on, 
which had a cloud save function, but I eventually abandoned that project to create Gateway.

The idea behind Gateway is to have all of your games in one place, without using too much memory or sacrificing functionality. 
While there are other game launchers out there, like Steam, Epic Games, and GOG Galaxy, Gateway aims to offer something unique.

While I wouldn't claim that Gateway is the perfect game launcher, it does offer features that other launchers don't.
And if you have any ideas for features that you think would make the app even better, please feel free to contact me at needanyhelpfor@gmail.com.
Additionally, the app is open source, with the caveat that if you choose to publish any changes, you don't make it a paid product and you give proper credit.

This is just the starting point for a brighter future ahead.
